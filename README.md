# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.


To integrate IoT sensors (for weather, NPK, moisture, motor control, etc.) with AI and make a smart autonomous farming system that runs on its own and guides farmers, you need to connect hardware + software + AI logic in a systematic way.

Here's a complete roadmap to build such a system:


---

🧩 1. COMPONENTS INVOLVED

📡 IoT Sensors

Soil Moisture Sensor – detects how wet the soil is.

NPK Sensor – detects nutrient levels.

DHT11/DHT22 Sensor – detects temperature and humidity.

Rain Sensor – for weather predictions.

Light Sensor (LDR) – monitors sunlight.

pH Sensor – checks soil acidity.

Water Level Sensor – tank level checking.


⚙️ Actuators

Water pump/motor – to irrigate crops.

Relay module – for controlling the motor.

Solenoid valve – for drip irrigation.


🧠 Microcontroller

Arduino UNO – to collect sensor data and control relays.

ESP32 / NodeMCU – for WiFi + cloud integration.


💾 Cloud / Database

Thingspeak / Firebase / AWS IoT – to store and access sensor data.

🤖 2. AI SYSTEM OVERVIEW

⛅ AI-based Decision Making:

AI takes real-time sensor data and makes decisions such as:

When to irrigate?

Whether soil nutrients are sufficient?

Should the farmer be notified for fertilization?

Weather prediction: should irrigation be skipped?


🧠 Machine Learning Models:

Crop recommendation model (based on NPK, pH, weather)

Irrigation scheduler (based on soil moisture + weather forecast)

Fertilizer recommendation (based on NPK and crop type)

Pest detection/alert (via camera or sensor inputs + AI image classification)



---

🔄 3. SYSTEM FLOW (INTEGRATION)

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Sensor Data Collection

All sensors connected to Arduino UNO/ESP32.

Data collected every few minutes.



2. Data Transmission

Arduino sends data via Serial or WiFi (ESP32) to cloud.

Use MQTT or HTTP protocol to send data to server or cloud DB.



3. Cloud Database

Store sensor data in real-time (Thingspeak, Firebase, or AWS).



4. AI Processing Layer

A Python-based AI server (hosted on cloud or local Raspberry Pi):

Fetches sensor data.

Runs ML models.

Decides whether to turn pump ON/OFF.

Predicts weather, irrigation need, or fertilizer deficiency.

Sends commands back to Arduino via Firebase/MQTT.




5. Actuation

If irrigation is needed:

AI sends command: "turn pump ON".

Arduino receives it and activates the relay.




6. Farmer Guidance (UI)

Mobile/Web app (React, Flutter, Android):

Shows current weather, soil status, NPK, moisture.

Sends alerts like:

“Irrigation turned ON for 15 mins.”

“Soil nitrogen is low – apply fertilizer.”

“No irrigation today due to expected rain.”


Allow manual override of automation.

💡 4. AI & ML MODELS YOU CAN USE

✅ Models:

Random Forest or XGBoost for:

Fertilizer prediction

Crop recommendation


LSTM (Neural Networks) for:

Weather prediction

Water usage optimization


Image Classification (CNNs):

For plant disease detection (optional, via camera)



📁 Model Training:

Train in Python using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

Use datasets like:

NPK soil datasets

Weather + crop datasets



Once trained, deploy models using:

Flask or FastAPI

Host on Raspberry Pi, Google Cloud, or Heroku



---

🧪 5. SAMPLE USE CASE

Example:

If moisture < 40% AND rain probability < 30%, AI will:

Turn ON motor for 15 mins.

Notify the farmer via app: “Irrigation performed due to dry soil.”

🔐 8. Extra Suggestions

Add auto-scheduling: AI learns the best irrigation time over time.

Use solar power for sustainability.

Add offline mode: Arduino works locally using rule-based logic if internet fails.
