# **App Name**: AgriMind

## Core Features:

- Smart Irrigation: AI-driven Irrigation Tool: Analyzes real-time sensor data (soil moisture, weather forecasts) to predict optimal irrigation schedules and autonomously control water pumps via relay module, preventing over or under-watering.
- Precision Fertilization: AI-based Nutrient Recommendation Tool:  Evaluates NPK sensor data and crop requirements to generate fertilizer recommendations, sent as alerts to the farmer's dashboard for timely nutrient adjustments.
- Sensor Data Visualization: Real-time Sensor Dashboard: Displays live data from IoT sensors (soil moisture, NPK levels, temperature, humidity) via charts and gauges for instant monitoring of farm conditions.
- Critical Alerts: Automated Alert System: Notifies farmers of critical events like low soil moisture, nutrient deficiencies, or frost warnings through push notifications, SMS or email.
- Remote Monitoring: Mobile and Web Interface:  Responsive UI built with React, accessible on mobile and web devices, enabling farmers to monitor and control their farms from anywhere.
- Manual Control: Manual Override Functionality: Provides farmers with the option to manually control actuators (water pumps, valves) directly through the dashboard, overriding AI-driven automation when necessary.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C) to evoke growth and nature.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral backdrop for data visualization.
- Accent color: Terracotta (#E07A5F) to highlight important alerts and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif providing both a modern look and a little warmth.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent sensor data and actions. Icons related to weather, soil, and equipment. 
- Dashboard layout prioritizes real-time data visualization with clear sections for sensor readings, alerts, and manual control options.
